## Features

- **Tile-based city building** — draw and place map tiles each turn; roads must align via compass connectors; named buildings spawn zombies and loot on placement
- **Isometric view** — toggle 3D perspective at any time; tilt/spin sliders, zoom (0.3×–3.0×), click-drag pan; pawns counter-rotate to always face the camera; zombie dogs render as a low dog silhouette
- **Online multiplayer** — 4-character room codes, host-controlled start, automatic state sync every 1.5 s via polling; rejoining via invite link is always supported
- **Combat** — d6 + bonuses; spend bullets or hearts to reroll/boost; weapon items; mid-movement combat resolves and resumes; knockout respawns you at the nearest start tile
- **Zombie AI** — moves toward nearest player each phase; respects walls, doors, and connectors; government-enhanced zombies move 2 spaces; zombie dogs move 2 spaces, deal ½ heart damage, and can stack 2 per subtile; zombie clowns use regular stats but have a unique sprite and token
- **Event cards** — draw up to 3 per turn, play one; includes player buffs, opponent disruption, zombie manipulation, and Book of the Dead page cards (Z4)
- **Air ducts (Mall Walkers)** — duct subtiles offer teleport to any adjacent duct store; costs your next movement roll; zombies cannot use ducts
- **Book of the Dead (Z4)** — stage pages in front of you (uses your event play slot); remove one per round for effects; staged pages reduce the Cabin Spell roll target
- **Cabin Spell win condition (Z4)** — clear all dogs from Cabin building subtiles, be on a building subtile, roll d6 ≥ 6 minus staged page count
- **Subway stations (Z6)** — enter any subway station building to skip your next turn (combat only); on the following turn teleport to any other station on the board; exiting the building cancels the subway use
- **Sewer Tokens (Z6 variant)** — each player starts with 2 tokens to place on road spaces; enter the sewer at any token to move through any subtile and skip zombie combat; pay 1 life or guts per turn to remain underground; exit at any token; knockout surfaces you instantly; manhole cover icon marks placed tokens on the board
- **Save / Load** — 5 localStorage slots; export/import as timestamped `.json`; saving blocked during pending actions
- **Bug reports** — in-game modal attaches game state + last 20 log entries and opens a GitHub issue automatically
- **Mobile UI** — bottom tab bar (Controls / Map / Game Info / Hand); turn-strip accordion on the Map tab; pass-device lock screen for same-device multiplayer
- **Deck management** — "Show cards" dropdown lists the remaining deck; drag-and-drop reordering in both map and event deck panels
- **School's Out Forever (Z5)** — campus tile set; introduces **guts tokens** (start with 3, max 5): roll a natural 6 in combat to gain 1, roll a natural 1 to lose 1; guts count (0–5) sets your event hand limit; you always keep at least 1 event card regardless; death resets guts to 3; the school helipad uses a `DESIGNATED` connector and can only be reached by passing through a named building; Z5 player event cards include campus items (Bat, Pool Cue, I've got a bike!), guts manipulation (Shots, Electro-Shock Therapy, Sedatives, Straight Jacket, Pillow Fight), deck management (Cram Session, Valedictorian), and social cards (Student Loan, Go Team Go!!!, Raise your hand..., Where's the Admin Bldg.?, Scalpel)
- **Collections** — tile and event decks configured independently at setup; standalone collections (Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, IC) get zone-isolated decks with gateway tiles unlocking them in mixed play; Z6 tiles and cards shuffle directly into the base deck

## Technical Notes

- **Pure Vanilla JS** — no frameworks, no bundler, no build step; everything loads via `<script>` tags in order; global scope throughout
- **Constants / core split** — `constants.js` holds all immutable config (`STEP`, `COLLECTIONS`, `COLLECTION_META`, `DIRS`, `TILE_DECK`, etc.) and loads first; `core.js` holds only the runtime `state` object and helpers; tile data loads after both
- **3×3 subtile grid** — each map tile has a 3×3 movement grid with per-subtile walkability, walls, doors, and air ducts defined in `subTilesTemplate`
- **Incremental board rendering** — cells are fingerprinted each render; only changed cells rebuild their DOM; global occupant map computed once per render pass; player lookups use a `Map` keyed by id
- **CSS design tokens** — `base.css` defines all colors, spacing, and player palette as CSS custom properties (`--player-P1`, `--cell-width`, `--wall-thickness`, `--lane-color`, etc.); components reference variables, not raw values
- **Serverless backend** — Vercel functions + MongoDB Atlas for multiplayer sessions and bug reports; polling-based sync (no WebSockets); rate-limited per IP via Atlas TTL collections
- **Zone isolation** — standalone collection tiles connect only to their own zone except through a gateway tile with a `DISABLE_ON_SOLO` connector; gateway tile unlocks the standalone deck when placed
- **Connector rule system** — per-connector placement rules on each tile: `SAME` (same collection), `ANY` (any tile), `ONLY` (specific tile name), `DESIGNATED` (requires neighbor to have `ONLY` targeting this tile), and collection-key rules for cross-zone restrictions; bidirectional — both sides of a road connection must agree
- **Companion tiles** — some tiles auto-place one or more tiles from the deck (or a set-aside reserve) when drawn; companions can be placed with a rotation offset relative to the main tile (e.g. Big Top 2 rotates 180° to connect N-to-N with Big Top 1); `companionOnly: true` tiles are never shuffled into any deck
- **Mixed-deck expansion** — Z6 tiles and cards have `standaloneDeck: false` and `requiresBase: DIRECTORS_CUT`; they are filtered directly into the main deck by `buildMapDeck()` with no zone isolation or gateway tiles
